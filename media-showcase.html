    <p>
      In this video, we explore how the JavaScript <code>map()</code> method works. It is a powerful array method that creates a new array by calling a provided function on every element in the calling array. This is particularly useful when transforming data, such as formatting strings, extracting values, or applying calculations. The map method does not mutate the original array but returns a new one with the results.
